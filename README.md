# Summer Camps
This repository contains generalized content for summer camps. 

"Don't panic."

## Navigation Guide
Each project contains the following:
1. **CoreProblemSets**: Each camp should have a backbone of individual coding challenges. 
 Individual coding challenges should go here and include a challenge description as well as a solution, if possible.
2. **TechTalks**: Material or links to interesting tech talk subjects
3. **GroupLead**: Some camps are more group oriented and some use group lead activities to introduce new concepts. Group lead problem sets or activities relevant to the camp subject matter go here.
4. **Fun**: Resources for preserving the sanity of you and your students in between intervals of coding. May or may not be relevant to subject matter of camp.
5. **Notes**: This repo is for coaches, leave some informal tips on what worked, what didn't and how the camp went.
